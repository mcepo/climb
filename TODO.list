-- OFFLINE PRECACHE on button click --

TODO: add store for offline use button, then cache:
  - store for offline use -
  - only for area types: Climbing site, Mountain, Crag
  - areas - all info + trails + images
  - routes - all info + images + pitches
  - images - all info
  - map tiles for that area
    - need area borders for map tiles to load + zoom every second zoom starting from most zoomed
  
  now i am storing everything as the user is surfing

-- OPTIMIZATION --

TODO: right now app data is being stored by the service worker per request
this produces a lot of over lapping data in the storage, a better solution would be
to store the vuex store to cache on mutations and remove the service worker cache for app data

TODO: add backend cache for area index, area get, route index?, route get, image tags 

TODO: use pregenerated stats in frontend

TODO: remove calls to grade and route length

TODO: run migrations on production server

TODO: create a cron job or a deamon

TODO: run update all areas on server

TODO: reduce payload sizes -> created_at and updated_at can be hidden

TODO: make a mapper so that i can send a plain array no need for a full json
  frontend, and backend mapper, pretty big job

-- REFACTORING --

TODO: add gradeService, typeService as vue plugin
