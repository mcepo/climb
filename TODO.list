  - only for area types: Climbing site, Mountain, Crag
  - areas - all info + trails + images
  - routes - all info + images + pitches
  - images - all info
  - map tiles for that area
    - need area borders for map tiles to load + zoom every second zoom starting from most zoomed

-- OPTIMIZATION --

TODO: right now app data is being stored by the service worker per request
this produces a lot of over lapping data in the storage, a better solution would be
to store the vuex store to cache on mutations and remove the service worker cache for app data

TODO: add backend cache for area index, area get, route index?, route get, image tags 
  or add it to area table as a computed value with a cron job
