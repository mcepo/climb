  sector, crag, mountain side can only have 

  FIX: on mobile if finished drawing but didn't double click
  the last point i can't save the tag

FIX: need to reduce image size by 100, not 10, or 
do a smarter way and fit image so that it has 
max 180 and longitude and 90 latitude ... EXTREMLY PRESSING 
maybe calculate the borders on the image when saving it
and store the borders in the database
that way i can always change the logic behind border calculation
without fucking up the images uploaded before that

it seams that left and rigth borders are limitless, but top and bottom
area max 90 so from -90bottom to 90top

that is greate because i can then add high quality panorama view
